It is through your senses and your thoughts that projects the world you perceive in your mind. What if this perception is faulty? What if our thoughts are erroneous? No doubt our perception of the world would be much different from what it is in reality.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>This is the case for people with schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia might see, hear, smell or feel things that other people don’t. They may form beliefs that are inconsistent with reality affecting the way they act and interact with others.
</strong></p><p><strong>Imagine yourself hearing a voice of a person that constantly tells you that you have done something wrong. Imagine yourself seeing figures that no one else sees but they are just so real to you alone. Imagine if yourself thinking that people around you are hostile to you and that they are all planning to harm you. These experiences can be extremely real and scary for someone with schizophrenia. It is therefore important to never judge someone else if they are reacting to something we can’t see, hear, or fathom. People with schizophrenia need support from others more than ever. With proper understanding of the illness they might withdraw from interacting with other people and become paranoid.
</strong></p><p><strong>Some people think that if you have schizophrenia you might be aggressive. While this is reported on the news, people with schizophrenia are put in bad light,but this isn’t true! Only a small percentage of people with schizophrenia will have violent outbursts, and most of the time these outbursts are directed at themselves. People with mental illness are more likely to be victims.
</strong></p><p><strong>A thing to bear in mind, when someone hears or sees things others don’t, it may not necessarily point towards schizophrenia. In some cultures, people who experience things that others don’t are considered to have gifts and be special.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>A Story of Schizophrenia:
</strong></p><p><strong>David is a 16-year-old high school student. One year ago his parents decided to divorce each other and that has caused great distress to him. He started refusing to go to school. He felt that he was being rejected by his classmates because of his parents’ divorce. He started hearing voices of his classmates discussing him and commanding him, not knowing that the voices were imaginary. At the same time, he started having the belief that his classmates hacked his computer as he has been seeing a particular advertisement about electrical appliances. He began to be very paranoid. Thoughts of taking revenge on his classmates surfaced in his mind and he refused to use any sort of electrical appliances. One day, David went to school with a knife attempting to harm his classmates. He was stopped and the police were called. The police took him to the hospital where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
