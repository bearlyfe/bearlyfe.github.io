A movie that marks its fourth remake since the original release back in 1937, A Star is Born features Lady Gaga as Ally Maine and Bradley Cooper as Jackson Maine. The movie was praised as a successful remake that is effective in retelling the musical romantic drama to the audience of the 21st century. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In the movie, Ally who performs at a drag bar as Edith Piaf is discovered by Jackson Maine, a country rock star. The encounter develops into a love story whereby the young and talented Ally rises to fame as Jackson starts to fade. The story portrays public figures falling in love and the jealousy related to the fame involved. However, probably the most compelling aspect of the movie is our protagonist battling with his substance abuse. The theme shrouds the entire plotline making it a necessary topic to bring up here on BearLyfe.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It is known that those who are under the spotlight in the entertainment industry have been inseparable from drugs. Lady Gaga once mentioned that she felt the need to be high to be creative. Indeed with all the pressure they have, it is not hard to imagine why pop stars need substances to cope with events in life. However, to cope via substance use is not the answer to the problem.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Jackson’s alcoholism and drug addiction causes him a lot of trouble. Arguably it is what leads to his eventual demise. He is under the influence of substances such that when his brother sells his father’s land he doesn’t even know it has happened. He goes on stage having taken too many drugs making him unable to perform properly and it causes a mess. Eventually, when Ally wins the Grammy Award, Jackson embarrasses her by getting on the stage and wetting his pants. These were just some of the things that happen on screen and it is not hard to tell that Jackson’s life broke down with the drugs and substances he took.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>But Jackson’s substance abuse did not only affect himself. It also affected the people around him including Ally of course. Ally experiences the damage that was caused by Jackson’s use of substance. She has arguments with Jackson when he is under the influence of drugs. She has to deal with the mess that Jackson creates. Ultimately, she has to experience the burden of Jackson’s death. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If substance and alcohol were a person, it would be the villain that takes the spotlight of the story. It causes Jackson to veer into his own collision and Ally to endure the loss of her loved one. While you might think that this villain is far away from you in the land of the rich and famous, this villain lurks in our everyday life. Let us learn from the blunt narration of the story, which neither romantises nor admonishes the effects of use of substances. There are better ways to cope with life and stress and substances should not be one of them.
