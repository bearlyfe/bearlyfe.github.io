            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>In the whole wide world, the second most common cause of death after accidents is suicide among young people. If you are thinking about committing suicide, or if you are worried about someone else who might have such thoughts, you should tell someone. It can be really hard to talk about the issues that people face because every person is unique and the problems we face arise from our unique circumstances. However, talking about it to someone you trust can be the starting point to getting help or helping others.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>What are the signs that someone is thinking of suicide?
</strong></p><p><strong>·       Talking about suicide either in person or on social media (examples include, someone posting “no one would miss me if I was gone”, or “I don’t want to live anymore” on Facebook).
</strong></p><p><strong>·       Having a plan to kill themselves
</strong></p><p><strong>·       Saying goodbye and doing final acts in preparation for death
</strong></p><p><strong>·       Increase in substance use
</strong></p><p><strong>·       Acting withdrawn
</strong></p><p><strong>These aforementioned signs are important and should be taken seriously. Some people talk about suicide or show other warning signs because they want help and don’t know how to ask. We all need attention and support from others and there isn’t a time more necessary when one has such heavy emotional burden that they would rather resolve to death.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>What are some things you can do?
</strong></p><p><strong>Listening is always important. Listen to people who are suicidal and hear about their problems. It is not necessary for you to offer wise words and advice to them, but it is of paramount importance that you remain non-judgemental. Try to convince them to go to a counsellor and go with them if that is possible. Call a crisis line with them or on your own, and also importantly tell them you care about them. If you are worried that a friend may be suicidal, talk to an adult you trust about it. Let your friend know that you are worried about them and that you can’t keep it a secret. You can’t predict how they will react and there is a chance they might be mad, but it’s a chance you need to take in order to keep them safe.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>What if someone is talking about suicide multiple times? How do I know if they are just joking or if they are serious about it?
</strong></p><p><strong>If you are worried about a friend, ask them directly if they are thinking about suicide. Clarify what their intentions are in a non-judgmental way. Although it may be awkward, it shows your friend that you care and want to help. This means a lot no matter if your friend is suicidal or not. Again, bear in mind that you don’t have to “solve” the other person’s problems in order to be helpful. If someone is suicidal they need help and support from trusted adults (counsellor, guidance counsellor, uncle, auntie, Elder, etc.) as well as from friends. Your method of helping is simply being there for them.
</strong></p><p><strong>Supporting someone who is suicidal or going through difficult times is no easy task. It requires a lot of mental strength in yourself too, thus it is of utmost importance that you take care of yourself. If you are bothered by certain emotions and thoughts, it is important for you too to talk to people you trust about your feelings. Sometimes very unfortunately, someone may commit suicide and you may feel guilty about not doing enough to help them. You may experience mixed feelings and you might question yourself whether you did the right thing. It is also important in this circumstance that you talk to people about your feelings. Bear this in mind: you are not alone and it is not your fault that whatever happened has happened.
