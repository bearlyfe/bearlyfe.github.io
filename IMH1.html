Ever since, there have been numerous attempts to decipher the human mind resulting in major paradigm shifts in thoughts and knowledge on how the mind works. Yet despite the attention that the mind receives, to this day it is still poorly understood. The sheer complexity of the brain and the mind makes it much more than just an organ composed of cells and chemicals. It is indeed a mystery that scientists and philosophers are continuously trying to solve.
</strong></p><p><strong>The mind is a fundamental part of the human body. We are creatures of “body” and “mind”. As it is such a significant part of our body, it is essential that we keep it healthy. Such is the concept of maintaining a good mental health. People might ask What’s the difference between having a good mental health and having a lack of mental illness? They are actually two very different things. 
</strong></p><p><strong>Good mental health is more than just a lack of mental illness. Let’s face it, life isn’t perfect for everyone. Good mental health comes from acknowledging our own shortcomings and coping with whatever life sends our way. It is about our minds striking a balance between the different emotions and thoughts that we have.  This balance comes when we find ways to deal with different parts of our lives – family, school, social life, relationships, activities, spiritual beliefs, and so on.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;How can we gain a better mental health? First, it is important to acknowledge that life is not perfect. We will encounter not only ups but also downs. We will face difficult and stressful situations at different junctions of our lives. We will sigh as things do not come our way. But do not fret! The thing is that we can all work at improving our mental health in the same way that we can change and improve our physical health. By developing strong relationships with people who can support us, and by learning healthier coping skills, we can build good mental health one step at a time. BearLyfe is here to assist you with your journey in discovering a better mental health and bearing with life issues.
