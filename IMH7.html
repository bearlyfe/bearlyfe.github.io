However, people may sometimes experience great sadness and worthlessness for an extended period of time. This sadness can be extremely intense making people lose interest in doing things that they love. They may even lose a sense of purpose and be burdened by negative feelings such that it becomes hard for them to get out of bed and face the day. In the most serious cases, people may start to question their own existence and see committing suicide as the only way out.  When this happens, a person is no longer just experiencing the transient feeling of sadness. These are symptoms that point towards depression.
</strong></p><p><strong>In light of the seriousness of this illness, it is important to look out for anyone around you who has some of these symptoms. Depression is not just feeling down. It can be extremely serious and therefore it is important to talk to the person about their issues. Try to help by offering support and being there for the person. Try to talk the person into seeking help from a counsellor and/ or social workers.
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>A Story of Depression:
</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew, a 16-year-old high school student, has been in a relationship with Laura ever since middle school. However, their relationship became complicated when they entered high school as both of them had their own goals and dreams. They ended up breaking up three months ago. Although Matthew accepted the break up as inevitable, he was extremely saddened by it. For three months he has been feeling this way. He used to be actively involved in school sports activities but he gave them up telling his friends that he is no longer interested in sports as he sees no point in them. He was also unable to fall asleep. Even if he did, he would wake up early in the morning and be barely able to get out of bed as he felt very down. His academics in the past months have been affected. Matthew felt like he was tired all the time and that he could no longer concentrate. He felt that life was not worth living and that the only way to get out of pain was to not live in this world anymore.
