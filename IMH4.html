            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Stigmatising people with mental illnesses is ubiquitous. A lot of people have a lack of understanding of mental health issues, making them prone to stigmatising people with mental illness. Even you and I might have some prejudices that we are unaware of. Let’s look at some possible questions. &nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>1)     Do you think some people with mental illness might appear aggressive?
</strong></p><p><strong>2)     Do you think people with eating disorders and substance abuse have self-inflicted disorders?
</strong></p><p><strong>3)     Do you think that people with mental illnesses are hard to talk to?
</strong></p><p><strong>If your answer is yes, you are not alone as many people think about these questions. In truth, people with mental illnesses are not normally aggressive. Sometimes we see in the media that mentally ill people are portrayed to be violent. This is emphasised in eye-catching headlines with disparaging tones. However, most psychiatric patients are not only non-violent, but are more likely to be victims of violence. Similarly, people with eating disorders and substance abuse are not self-inflicted sufferers. People with eating disorders have erroneous beliefs regarding their own body image that stem not from their own wishes but from the disease state. People with substance abuse are troubled by physical and mental addiction to whatever substance they are taking. They too did not choose to be the way they are. They might have made wrong decisions to start taking substances, but sometimes despite how determined they are to quit they are unable to. People with mental illnesses are most often not hard to talk to. Other than very severe cases of mental illnesses, most people actually communicate like you and me.
</strong></p><p><strong>The stigma doesn’t just stop here though. The social stigma is reflected on people with mental illnesses as a perceived stigma. This is when people with mental illnesses internalise the stigma and their own perception of the discrimination. People with mental illness feel that they are treated differently because of their illness. They feel that their disease is a sign of weakness and failure. As a result, people may be in denial of their disease and become more reluctant to seek help. This is not good though! We should help these people to seek help just as we would help people with physical diseases.
