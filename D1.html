In Hong Kong, it is not the most abused drug, but still very common among youngsters. Before we get into the series of posts about Cannabis, let’s first get some facts/terms straight! 
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Have you ever been confused over the terms Cannabis/Marijuana/Weed/Pot…? Well I know I have, and because of this confusion I had to go over to Google to clarify these terms, but ultimately these all refer to the same thing – a plant called Cannabis that is used for medical and recreational purposes. The main active ingredients of this plant include: Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabinol (CBL). THC is the main ingredient in making you “high”. The different names that derive from the plant is simply because there are different ways of preparing the same drug, but they all have the same active ingredients. 
</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The main three forms of Cannabis are: marijuana, hashish and hash oil. Marijuana is the unprocessed form of cannabis and is the most common and widely consumed type. It consists of leaves and buds of the female Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica plants and is prepared by having the leaves and buds dried. People smoke marijuana in hand-rolled cigarettes or in pipes or water pipes. They can also be inhaled using vaporizers which can pull the active ingredients from the marijuana and collect their vapor in a storage unit. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Hashish (or known as Hash for short) is made from the resin (a secreted gum) of the cannabis plant. It is dried and pressed into blocks to produce an oily, solid substance. It can be consumed orally or smoked, and vaped. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Hashish oil is the most potent form of marijuana, that is thick oil obtained from hashish. It can be sold in tiny bottles or sealed plastic bags. Since it is so strong, only a small amount is needed to elicit its effects. It is also commonly smoked. 	
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>As you might have seen in movies, TV shows, marijuana can be made into Marijuana edibles – most commonly in the form of brownies, cookies, or even candies. You may or may not be able to detect the smell of marijuana in food as the other ingredients can mask its distinct smell, making it more difficult to identify. Also, the amount of THC can vary in edible marijuana edibles, making it difficult to control how much is being consumed. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>BearLyfe advice: 
</strong></p><p><strong>Having a basic idea about the different forms of Cannabis will help you to be able to identify it when you encounter the drug. You may be able to recognize its distinct smell to help you identify the company of a cannabis smoker. But bear in mind that the marijuana edibles may have masked the smell so be particularly vigilant and don’t eat or drink anything when in doubt about its source. Be particularly careful when you see food packaging with labels that say the ingredient “THC” is present!
