For people with bipolar disorder however, this fluctuation becomes extreme and out of proportion to the things that are going on in life. The moods are sometimes seen as either “highs” or “lows”.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>Ok, we know what “lows” are manifested in depression. People feel profound sadness and that is definitely a concern for a person’s wellbeing. If the “highs” are opposite of “lows” which are undesirable, wouldn’t they be desirable then? It is true that people may feel emotions that are deemed desirable. They may be elated, energetic and active. A person may feel that they is invincible and that they will be able to achieve a lot of things. However, not everything is desirable with the “highs”. They can make people irritable, agitated, and impulsive. This means they might do something without really thinking it through, or they might have poor judgment. Sometimes this may affect their relationship with others as they are more prone to get into arguments.  
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>A Story of Bipolar Disorder:
</strong></p><p><strong>Alex is a 19-year-old university student. A year ago he was diagnosed with clinical depression at the university health clinic. During his episode of depression, he would not leave home and not take an interest in anything. He felt increasingly guilty about himself and thought that he was no good. Life seemed to have drained from him and he felt grossly unwell, mentally and physically. The doctor prescribed him with medication to which he responded well and he was able to cope with his mood symptoms. Two weeks ago, when Alex’s exam results came out, he started acting weirdly. He became extremely energetic and talkative. It was almost as if his mind was like a motor that couldn’t stop. He had various ideas and believed that he was capable of starting a new project which could save the world from destruction. He pursued various new interests, taking up a new language, a new sport, and a new instrument. He also became extremely irritable around his friends and family and had frequent arguments with them. Alex did not require much sleep. The past two weeks he has been running on three hours of sleep but he was not tired during the daytime. As his mother noticed that Alex was not his usual self, she went with him to see a private psychiatrist. Alex was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
