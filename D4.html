However, what you may not know is that Meth is known to be highly associated with psychosis, making it very dangerous in the household. Research has shown that 88% of Meth users have other psychiatric co-morbidities, 76% have psychosis, making it surpass rates of substance-induced psychosis associated with other commonly misused drugs. The hallucinations are known to be predominantly auditory, but can be visual or tactile. A heavy meth user may have delusions of persecution, having symptoms similar to that of schizophrenia, with a series of abnormal social behaviours such as confused thinking, being highly suspicious and hearing voices. There are also cases where patients who use large daily doses of the drug report that there are ants or other insects crawling under their skin (eg, formication, “meth mites”) and might present with infected excoriations of their skin as a result of attempting to remove insects.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>One patient in the Tai Po hospital, an 18-year-old boy who had abused Meth for two years, was highly suspicious of people harming him, to the point that his family was no longer able to reason with him and he was left with no friends. His memory also deteriorated to a stage where he could not remember his name and telephone number.

</strong></p><p><strong><em>Can a person get overdosed on Meth? 
</em></strong></p><p><strong>Yes, it is possible to get overdosed on Meth. A person overdosed with Meth is likely to be very anxious and have difficulty in breathing; it often leads to stroke, heart attack, or even kidney failure. These conditions can lead to death. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong><em>Bearlyfe advice: 
</em></strong></p><p><strong>As a highly addictive and dangerous drug, people can suffer from strong physical and psychotic symptoms and other severe withdrawal symptoms. If possible, it is best to come off the drug with medical supervision!
