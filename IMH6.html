Anxiety is the emotional and physical fear response to a perceived threat. However, not all of us who have anxiety suffer from anxiety disorder. The reason is because anxiety that is deemed pathological is in excess, irrational, and out of proportion to the trigger event or without identifiable cause. Anxiety disorder can be distressing, affecting way of life and day to day activities. They are very common and affect about 1 in 10 people. There are different types of anxiety disorders like general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias. The symptoms of a panic or anxiety attack can include sweating, headache, nausea, tunnel vision and a racing heart. Sometimes, people can feel like they are losing control or feel like they are dying. Let’s read about two stories that may give you an idea what these mental illnesses are like.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>A Story of Generalised Anxiety Disorder:
</strong></p><p><strong>Jessie, an 18-year-old, is a freshman at university. Her family is tight on finance; as a result, she has to undertake a part-time job at a fast food restaurant. With a lot of school work in her way, Jessie has to balance her academics with her part time job. In order to reduce the financial burden on her family, Jessie obtained a financial scholarship. However, as she needs to maintain a certain GPA to renew it, Jessie is worried that she hasn't have enough time to study..
</strong></p><p><strong>One day her father was involved in an accident at work. He was considering early retirement due to the work related injury. She worried that this will make her family financially unstable. Since then, she has not been able to fall asleep until late at night. She also had muscle pain and headache that lasted for seven months. Her parents have reassured her about the family’s situation but she is still worried. The constant worry is affecting her daily life as she has grown to be extremely fatigued. Yesterday she was chastised for getting an order wrong at work. She now fears that she will be fired from her job as a result of her mistake.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>A Story of Panic Disorder:
</strong></p><p><strong>John, a 17-year-old, studies at a prestigious high school. His parents have high expectations for him and he has consistently performed well at school. As his public exams are approaching, he is pressured to study hard to get into the university of his dreams. As a result, he makes himself study as much as possible. He doesn’t engage in anything that would otherwise help him relax, thinking that he can’t to do so. He continued to study hard for many months. One day when he was going to school on a minibus, he didn’t feel well. Nothing happened around him in his surroundings but he felt like he was going to lose control. He felt like his heart was going to jump out of his chest and he was sweating profusely. His head was dizzy and he felt nauseous. He quickly got off the bus at the next stop. He noted that those symptoms came for around 15 minutes. Afterwards he recovered from the symptoms. All seemed well for John as he was no longer experiencing the symptoms. However, the symptoms came back and presented themselves the way they did when John was on the bus previously. The symptoms appeared on and off for half a year. John was greatly distressed and he felt he could no longer focus properly on his studies. He talked to his school social worker who referred him to a psychiatrist. He was later diagnosed with panic disorder.
