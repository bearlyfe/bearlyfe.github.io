We are dictated by our mental processes and the life events that cause them. Our minds are fabulous at creating memory and helping us pull through life events, but it may overdo what it is good at and make our stress become out of hand. This is why we need to learn to deal with stress. The method we do it is not to escape from stress, but to cope with it. We can all learn more and healthier ways of doing so. Life is tough with all the things that we need to do and achieve, however a good coping mechanism can make hard times easier to deal with. It is important that we as individuals develop our own healthy coping strategies.
</strong></p><p><strong>There are many ways this can be done. The following ways are useful and are used by clinical psychologists as well as life coaches. These methods are stress relieving and do not take up too much of your time.
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1)     Meditate
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2)     Reach out
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>3)     Mindfulness
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>4)     Rest and Decompress 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><em><a href="activities.html">Meditation</a>
</em></strong></p><p><strong>Have you ever laid in bed wrestling with your thoughts that would not go away? You want to put things down but it is simply impossible. Your mind is too active and it seems that no matter how hard you try to calm yourself down, it does not work. The more you tell yourself not to think, the more rebellious your mind becomes. If this happens, it would be worth the while to try meditating.
</strong></p><p><strong>According to the Oxford Dictionary, meditation is “the act of giving your attention to only one thing”. Different religions practise it but it is not strictly a religious practice. In fact, it is much more of a mental training. Research suggests that daily meditation can alter the brain’s neural pathways and make it more resilient and to better cope with stress. In addition, people who practise meditation are generally happier and more contented than the average person.
</strong></p><p><strong>A way to meditate can be demonstrated as follows:
</strong></p><p><strong>1)    Sit erect in a straight back chair with good posture. Have your feet flat on the&nbsp;</strong><strong>ground and your posture self-supporting. Close your eyes.
</strong></p><p><strong>2)    Direct your attention to your breath. Focus on the in-breaths and out-breaths.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Observe the breaths as they are and do not try to change anything.
</strong></p><p><strong>3)    If your mind wanders, bring your attention back to the breaths. Observe what&nbsp;</strong><strong>thoughts and feelings are bothering you. It is important not to see a distraction&nbsp;</strong><strong>as failure.
</strong></p><p><strong>4)    Allow your mind to focus on your breath for one minute. Gently open your </strong><strong>eyes and take in the surrounding environment again.
</strong></p><p><strong>Think of meditation as a lifestyle and not a chore. It is not a product of an afterthought, but more of an ingredient for daily life. Integrate it with your life and dedicate time to it. After all, it does not take a lot of time. Always remember, meditation is neither about “success” nor “failure”. It might feel difficult and ineffective when your mind drifts off and you feel that you have failed your meditation. However, this is not true. Every meditation is of benefit to you psychologically. Persistence and perseverance is the key.
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><a href="activities.html">Reaching out</a>
</strong></p><p><strong>Human beings have been social animals since the very beginning of time. This is how human beings have flourished and survived the challenges throughout the centuries. Unfortunately, as we continue to develop technologically, our sense of closeness and togetherness with others has shrunk significantly.
</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes what we need during times of stress is to have someone to talk to about our issues. It is not necessarily true that by talking to people you may have your issues solved, but that by talking to people you are able to share the load of the burden with them. This allows everything to be much more bearable because it is no longer you alone against the world, but you as a team member against those issues.  
</strong></p><p><strong>People to reach out to include family members, friends, boy/girlfriends, and even some professionals. Anyone who you know who cares about you, and that you can trust, are great candidates, as people you should reach out to. Each and every one of us have different circumstances and therefore the people to reach out to may be different. Never be afraid to reach out. It is not a sign of weakness telling people about your stress. You might think that you are selfish by getting others involved in your issues, but it is simply not true. People who you are close with, or professionals, are more than willing to help. 
</strong></p><p><strong>These people serve as the strongest mental support net and that you too must remember to help those who are stressed out. Be approachable and a good listener just as you would want the people you reached out to, to be.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><a href="activities.html">Mindfulness</a></strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Meditation requires focusing our attention on only one thing such as a positive mantra. There is a form of meditation that requires focus on our own body and breath and that is the practice of mindfulness. Mindfulness allows us to be aware of our own existence that sometimes we might forget. You might think that this is ridiculous as how can we forget our own existence. However, it is possible because we human beings are creatures of habits. A lot of the times we autopilot through life and forget to savor every moment especially the simple things we do in life.
</strong></p><p><strong>Mindfulness is the act of reclaiming ourselves and feeling our presence in the present moment. It is not about the future and neither is it about the past. Different things we may do include focusing more on our sensations. Next time when you walk, dwell on the strides that you take and the sensations that you are flooded with while traveling. Next time when you eat, slowly dwell on the taste, consistency, texture of the food. This way, we are living every moment of our lives much fuller and our presence in the present moment surpasses any stress that we experience.
</strong></p><p><strong>Practising mindfulness is similar to practising other meditation methods, but it is distinct in that it focuses on self. Below is an example how you can practise mindfulness in your everyday life.
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><em>1) Sit erect in a straight back chair with good posture. Have your feet flat on the ground and your posture self-supporting. Close your eyes.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>2) Direct your attention to your physical sensations by firstly focusing on the sensation of touch where your feet contacts the ground and your rear contacts the chair. Spend some time exploring these sensations.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>3) Focus on sensation of your feet. Ponder on the sensation for a moment. While keeping your focus on your feet, also focus on your soles of your feet and ponder on the sensation. Move on to include sensation of your legs, thigh, hips, back, chest, head and face. Notice how the sensations come and go.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>4) Hold your focus on your whole body and spend a minute or two resting in the awareness of it. If your mind wanders, do not blame yourself. Gently escort your focus back to the sensations.
</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Just like any meditation in general, integrate it with your daily life and dedicate time to it. After all, it does not take a lot of time. Always remember, meditation is neither about “success” nor “failure”. It might feel difficult and ineffective when your mind drifts off and you feel that you have failed your mindfulness practice. However, it is not true. Every mindfulness practice is of benefit to you psychologically. Persistence and perseverance is the key.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><a href="activities.html">Rest and decompress</a>
</strong></p><p><strong>The difference between humans and machine is that humans are much more versatile and that we have emotions. While it is obvious to most people that we are very different from machines, a lot of people tend to forget that we are not machines in that we need rest and to decompress. Some people work very hard striving for excellence in life, but they are unaware that their very trait of dedication and determination to work/study may contribute to their eventual burn out. The message is simple, we all need to rest no matter what. It is unwise to push ourselves too far off our own limits.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>No matter what we do, we need to rest. Breaks can be as short as you want it to be or as long as an extended holiday. No matter what form they take, breaks are just as essential. Taking breaks is a way to recharge and regain momentum so that you can get back to work freshened up mentally and physically. Rest also includes sleeping at night. And yes it is important. Sleep helps rejuvenate our energy and makes us function better the following day.  
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>On top of taking breaks and rest, it is also important to decompress. Methods of decompressing can vary from person to person. The most obvious way would be to have massage or water therapy that can instantly release the tension from your muscles including your mental muscles. Other ways include pursuing hobbies and doing things that you like. Ask yourself, what do you like doing and what gives you the feeling of being relaxed? Only you yourself have the insight to what makes you feel better.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So remember when you face stress, one of the best self help methods is rest and decompress.</strong></p></div>
