            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>In the year 2000, a band made its debut to the world with its first ever album Hybrid Theory. They rose to fame instantly with their songs that touched people’s hearts with universal feelings and emotions that the artists experienced themselves. That band is none other than Linkin Park. Some of the most notable songs that they wrote are In the End, Numb, Burn it Down. To date they have sold more than seventy million albums worldwide and won two Grammy Awards. &nbsp;</strong><br><strong></strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Chester Bennington played an important role as one of the lead singers in the band. On July 20, 2017 he was found dead at home by his housemaid. Chester Bennington hung himself after consuming copious amounts of alcohol. His death was ruled and confirmed to be a suicide. Chester’s passing came as a heartbreaking news to his family, friends, bandmates, and fans. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Why did Chester commit suicide? He had everything he could ever ask for as a dad, husband, bandmate, and friend to others. Other than suffering from issues with drugs and alcohol, Chester had an ongoing battle with depression. In 2015, he opened up about his depression.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>He described that he had difficulties in life. Although it was great sometimes, a lot of the time he felt that it was really hard for him. No matter what he did, he found himself stuck in a cycle that repeated itself. He did not want to feel anything or do anything. It was not until he separated himself from the situation that he was able to see the situation clearly. That was only possible however if he broke out of the cycle.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>When he was alone, he would be stuck in his own head where he described it to be a bad neighborhood. He became critical of himself and felt that part of him was trying to take himself down. He felt better when he was distracted with things outside including working on the different albums, but as soon as he was left to himself his mind took over.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The scary thing was that two days before his suicide, Chester was videoed eating jelly bean with his children. Depression doesn’t have a face and it may be missed easily. It is a struggle internally for those who go through it. Chester went through it and he shared his experience with the world. As Chester described in his song Heavy, to people with depression “why is everything so heavy?”. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Chester showed the world his personal battle against depression by opening up about it and writing about it in his songs. In his song Battle Symphony, we can hear his struggle with the disease. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>“I hear my battle symphony
</strong></p><p><strong>All the world in front of me
</strong></p><p><strong>If my armor breaks
</strong></p><p><strong>I'll fuse it back together”
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It was something he went through and sadly cost him his life. When depression calls upon a battle, let the symphony ring. Persevere and fuse your armor back together. Not just by yourself though, do it with the help of others.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you know someone who is suffering from depression and who might be potentially suicidal,, please contact the suicide prevention hotline.
